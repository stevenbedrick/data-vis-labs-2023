This week, you will begin working on your academic portfolio site. The deliverable for the week is a URL (on Netlify, or wherever) for a simple personal site with the following criteria:

1. A completed "About" page, containing a short professional bio following the methods & advice given on the [course site for today](https://dmice.ohsu.edu/bedricks/courses/bmi525/syllabus/6-sixth.html)
2. A photo (not necessarily of you)
3. At least one stylistic aspect changed from the original template (font, color, etc.)
    - Remember to _not_ change the relevant part of the template directly, but instead to make your own copy in your project's `layouts` or `static` directories
4. A sub-page containing one of the visualizations that you have created for an assignment/lab in this class, with description.
5. All boilerplate (example) content that came with the theme should be removed, config settings updated (e.g., the page title should not be "New Blogdown Site" or something like that), etc.
